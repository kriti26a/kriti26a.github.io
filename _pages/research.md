<div style="text-align: justify;">
The paper looks at the impact of reforms that give equal land rights to daughters on the women empowerment and child education ability. Different domains of women empowerment are represented by various indices created using the IRT Models. The paper, on using propensity score matching with triple differences, finds that the reforms have a significant effect on gender attitudes, personal autonomy and achievements of women. There is also a significant positive effect on children's cognitive ability. This is primarily driven by the improvements in ability of girls.

### 2. Does land buy influence? Land ownership and women’s bargaining power in Gurgaon district, Haryana, India
<div style="text-align: justify;">
This paper intends to answer whether land ownership in the Gurgaon district of Haryana, India has increased women’s autonomy. In order to test the impact of land ownership, different domains of women empowerment are considered. Due to endogeneity of land ownership, Instrumental variable method is used to establish a causal effect of ownership of land on women’s bargaining power. The findings indicate that women who own land tend to have a greater say in decision-making process, more freedom of movement and, more progressive attitudes. They also tend to be more educated, know how to use computer, converse in English and work outside. The implementation of the National HSA amendment (2005) is quite poor and there are very few women who receive their rightful share. This is primarily because of the patriarchal and patrilocal nature of the society in Haryana (as well as India). While the situation is gradually changing, there is a long road ahead.
